## If your setup is not working...

You can install Visual Studio Code from here: [https://code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com)

The Java Development Kit is available here: [http://jdk.java.net/13/](http://jdk.java.net/13/)


## Learning Arduino

We are using Arduino to learn about electronics and how to write code for programming electronic devices. Helpful links:

### Downloading the software

https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software

Try the link `Windows app Requires Win 8.1 or 10`, and see if you are allowed to install that. You may need an administrator key, or you can download the link `Windows ZIP file for non admin install`

### Simple example: Blink

Try this example to verify that everything is working. You will need an Arduino and a USB cable that fits. https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/Blink

### Arduino language reference

Arduino "Sketches" are written in a variant of C++. Language reference: https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/

### Using the distance sensor

We are using a common ultrasonic distance sensor called an HC-SR04. See this page for details: https://www.makerguides.com/hc-sr04-arduino-tutorial/

Measuring distance with this sensor works like this:

* Set the TRIG pin to LOW
* Wait 2 microseconds
* Set the TRIG pin to HIGH
* Wait 10 microseconds
* Set the TRIG pin to LOW
* Measure how long it takes for the ECHO pin to switch from high to low voltage

On the Arduino:
* you can set pins to HIGH or LOW using the `digitalWrite` command.
* you can wait for for a number of microseconds using the `delayMicroseconds` command
* you can wait for a pin to change from high to low (or low to high) using the `pulseIn` command

Here is a sample implementation that returns the measured distance in centimeters.

```
// Returns distance in cm
long getDistance() {
  digitalWrite(trig, LOW);
  delayMicroseconds(2);
  digitalWrite(trig, HIGH);
  delayMicroseconds(10);
  digitalWrite(trig, LOW);
  long echoTime = pulseIn(echo, HIGH);
  long distance = (echoTime/2) / 29.1;
  return distance;
}
```

### Figuring out what your Arduino is doing

Use the `Serial.print` and `Serial.println` functions to write messages to the Serial monitor.

For example:
```
int b = 123;
Serial.print("Brightness:");
Serial.println(b);
```

will print out:
`Brightness:123`
